# Login-Page-Project

This project is a simple and interactive login page built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with Arabic language support and modern Glassmorphism design.

## Features
- **Login Page:**
- Fields to enter username and password.
- Toggle the appearance of the password using an icon.
- Validate login data.
- **Home Page:**
- Welcome page displayed upon successful login.
- **Modern Design:**
- Glassmorphism style with gradient background and smooth transitions.
- Responsive layout for different screen sizes.

## File Structure
- **`login.html`:** The main login page with a form for user credentials.
- **`R_home.html`:** The home page displayed after successful login.
- **`style.css`:** The style table for the entire project, with Glassmorphism design implementation.

## How it works
1. The user enters the username and password in the login form.
2. The script validates the credentials:
- **Username:** `Ismail Ibrahim`
- **Password:** `23112004`
3. If the credentials are correct, the user is redirected to the home page (`R_home.html`).
4. If the credentials are incorrect, the user is notified of the error with an alert.
5. Toggle password visibility allows the user to display or hide the password text.

## Technologies used
- **HTML5**: For structuring the pages.
- **CSS3**: For designing with a modern look and feel.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and login validation.

## How to use
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-link]
```
2. Open the `login.html` file in your browser.
3. Test the login functionality using the credentials provided above.

## Future improvements
- Add server-side verification and authentication.
- Implement a registration page for new users.
- Add database integration to store and manage user credentials.
- Make pages fully responsive to all devices.
